# CinematicCompilerBackend

Backend code I created for SWE 3313: Intro to Software Enginnering.

This code was created to be used for a web app that allowed users to helps them find which streaming servuse has the movie or show they are looking for.

This was writen in java using Eclipse IDE and the The Movie Database (TMDB) API. 

Currently only pulls the first 20 results from the API. Will later edit so it can pull all results.
